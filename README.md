Overview
  The Thoughts Project is a web application built using Node.js and Express.js for the backend, with Sequelize for database management and MySQL as the database system. The application allows users to register, log in, and manage     their thoughts securely.

Learnings
  Git and GitHub
  Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience with version control using Git and GitHub. This includes:
  * Creating and managing repositories
  * Branching and merging workflows
  * Collaborating using pull requests and code reviews

Node.js
I developed a strong understanding of Node.js, including:

  * Setting up a Node.js environment
  * Managing dependencies with npm
  * Writing asynchronous JavaScript
    
Express.js
Using Express.js, I learned to:

  * Set up a robust server
  * Handle routing and middleware
  * Manage error handling and logging
    
Sequelize
Sequelize ORM provided me with:

  * Skills to define and manage models
  * Performing CRUD operations
  * Handling associations between models

    
MySQL
I improved my database management skills with MySQL:

  * Designing and managing databases
  * Writing efficient SQL queries
  * Integrating MySQL with Sequelize

User Authentication
Implementing user authentication helped me understand:

  * Setting up user registration and login
  * Managing sessions and cookies
  * Implementing authorization middleware

Password Encryption
For security, I learned about password encryption:

  * Using bcrypt for hashing passwords
  * Managing secure user data
  * Best practices in password security
